/// Allocates memory that is freed when the pool is destructed.
///
/// Implements a very basic form of garbage collection. When a piece of memory
/// is requested by calling allocate, the pool returns a memory location in the
/// current slab, or allocates a new slab of memory. The size of these slabs
/// increase with every slab created, thus reducing the number of allocations
/// requested from the allocator. For excessively large pieces of memory a slab
/// of custom size is allocated and returned.
///
/// The implementation borrows heavily from llvm::BumpPtrAllocatorImpl.
///
/// \note No destructor is called when the memory of the pool is freed.
///       Therefore the memory returned by this allocator is not suited to be
///       used for objects that require destruction (most classes in the STL),
///       unless you manually call their destructor at some point.
